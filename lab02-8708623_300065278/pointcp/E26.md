# Your solution to E26

| Design | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | Much quicker computation for processing Polar coordinates. No conversion needed if Polar coordinates are inputed| Slower to initialize when Cartesian coordinate is inputed. Cartesian coordinates are not stored and thus must be computed upon request |
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | Much quicker computation for processing Cartesian coordinates. No conversion needed if Cartesian coordinates are inputed | Slower to initialize when Polar coordinate is inputed. Polar coordinates are not stored and thus must be computed upon request |
| Design 6: Interface with designs 2 and 3 as classes implementing it. | Can be implemented either Design 2 or Design 3. Uses more general methods that can be used by Design 2 and 3 | Still slower than Designs 2 and 3 since it stores both types of coordinates |
